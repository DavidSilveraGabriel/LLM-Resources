# LLM: my journey Ôºà„Å•Ôø£3Ôø£Ôºâ„Å•‚ï≠‚ù§ÔΩû

## The objetive: 

The objective of this repository is to structure all the knowledge acquired in my learning path about LLM, with code implementations, demos and reflections. üòé
As a second objective, this is to be useful for the opensource community, providing them with an example route so that they can learn from my successes and mistakes.

### Soooo.. What is LLM? ü§î

LLM in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing is stands for **Large Language Model**.

[Can you explain it better?]

### Large Language Model (LLM)
A **Large Language Model** is a type of machine learning model that has been trained on a vast amount of textual data to understand and generate natural language. These models are capable of performing a variety of language-related tasks such as translation, summarization, text generation, question answering, and more... üëÄ

### Characteristics of LLMs:
1. **Size**: These models are extremely large, with millions or even billions of parameters. Examples include models like OpenAI's GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters.
2. **Training**: They are trained on extensive amounts of text collected from the internet, books, articles, and other textual resources. This allows them to learn complex patterns and nuances of language.
3. **Capabilities**: Due to their size and extensive training, they can perform advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks with high accuracy.
4. **Generalization**: They are capable of generalizing knowledge to a wide variety of tasks, even those for which they were not explicitly trained.

### Applications:
- **Virtual Assistants**: Such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.
- **Content Generation**: Creation of articles, stories, and other texts.
- **Machine Translation**: Translation of text between different languages.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assessing the tone or emotion in texts.
- **Chatbots**: Automated conversational systems for customer service and other interactions.

### Example of an LLM:
OpenAI's GPT-4o is a prominent example of an LLM. is a model that can reason across audio, vision, and text in real time, due to that, the potential of this kind of models named multimodals is unbeliable.

In summary, in the context of artificial intelligence, LLM refers to "Large Language Model," which are language models trained on large amounts of textual data to understand and generate natural language with high accuracy.

## What now?

Soo.. after know that, what now? how i can start learning more in deepht about LLMs and the core concepts about this amazing field of AI? 

Well my friend, affter years of trying learn programming by myself, ive learned one thing very well, and is that for really learn something in programing, you need start coding as soon as possible
Before learn the theory, start with the practice, we firts learn how to speack, then the gramatics, what is a verb, adjetive, and those things that was my nightmare when i was a kid T.T 
and after do you coding workhome, then teach to someone what have you learned, because this will make that you interiorize the knowlodge and make it yours.
You really know something when you can explain it to your imaginary friend named [INSERT NAME].
