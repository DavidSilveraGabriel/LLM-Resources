# LLM: My Journey （づ￣3￣）づ╭❤～

## Objective

The objective of this repository is to structure all the knowledge acquired in my learning path about LLMs, with code implementations, demos, and reflections. 😎

Additionally, I hope this serves the open-source community by providing an example route so others can learn from my successes and mistakes.

### So... What is LLM? 🤔

In the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing, LLM stands for **Large Language Model**.

[Can you explain it better?]

### Large Language Model (LLM)

A **Large Language Model** is a type of machine learning model trained on a vast amount of textual data to understand and generate natural language. These models can perform various language-related tasks such as translation, summarization, text generation, question answering, and more... 👀

### Characteristics of LLMs

1. **Size**: These models are extremely large, with millions or even billions of parameters. Examples include models like OpenAI's GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters.
2. **Training**: They are trained on extensive amounts of text collected from the internet, books, articles, and other textual resources. This allows them to learn complex patterns and nuances of language.
3. **Capabilities**: Due to their size and extensive training, they can perform advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks with high accuracy.
4. **Generalization**: They are capable of generalizing knowledge to a wide variety of tasks, even those for which they were not explicitly trained.

### Applications

- **Virtual Assistants**: Such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.
- **Content Generation**: Creation of articles, stories, and other texts.
- **Machine Translation**: Translation of text between different languages.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assessing the tone or emotion in texts.
- **Chatbots**: Automated conversational systems for customer service and other interactions.

### Example of an LLM

OpenAI's GPT-4 is a prominent example of an LLM. It is a model that can reason across audio, vision, and text in real-time. The potential of these kinds of models, known as multimodals, is unbelievable.

In summary, in the context of artificial intelligence, LLM refers to "Large Language Models," which are language models trained on large amounts of textual data to understand and generate natural language with high accuracy.

## What Now?

So... after knowing that, what's next? How can I start learning more in-depth about LLMs and the core concepts of this amazing field of AI?

Well, my friend, after years of trying to learn programming by myself, I've learned one thing very well: to truly learn something in programming, you need to start coding as soon as possible. Before learning the theory, start with practice. We first learn how to speak, then the grammar, what is a verb, adjective, and those things that were my nightmare when I was a kid T.T 

After doing your coding homework, teach someone what you have learned because this will help you internalize the knowledge and make it yours. You really know something when you can explain it to your imaginary friend named [INSERT NAME].

Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of converting an image with text into a text format that can be read by machines. For example:
